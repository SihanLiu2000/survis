	abstract = {More and more users prefer to ask their technical questions online. For machines, understanding a question is nontrivial. Current approaches lack explicit background knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a novel technical question understanding approach to recommending probable solutions to users. First, a knowledge graph is constructed which contains abundant technical information, and an augmented knowledge graph is built on the basis of the knowledge graph, to link the knowledge graph and documents. Then we develop a light weight question driven mechanism to select candidate documents. To improve the online performance, we propose an index-based random walk to support the online search. We use comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a large scale of real-world query logs. Our system outperforms main-stream search engine and the state-of-art information retrieval methods. Meanwhile, extensive experiments conﬁrm the efﬁciency of our index-based online search mechanism.},

	abstract = {To alleviate sparsity and cold start problem of collaborative filtering based recommender systems, researchers and engineers usually collect attributes of users and items, and design delicate algorithms to exploit these additional information. In general, the attributes are not isolated but connected with each other, which forms a knowledge graph (KG). In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), an end-to-end framework that captures inter-item relatedness effectively by mining their associated attributes on the KG. To automatically discover both high-order structure information and semantic information of the KG, we sample from the neighbors for each entity in the KG as their receptive field, then combine neighborhood information with bias when calculating the representation of a given entity. The receptive field can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity information and capture users’ potential long-distance interests. Moreover, we implement the proposed KGCN in a minibatch fashion, which enables our model to operate on large datasets and KGs. We apply the proposed model to three datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation, and experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong recommender baselines.},

	abstract = {Question answering over knowledge graph (QA-KG) aims to use facts in the knowledge graph (KG) to answer natural language questions. It helps end users more efficiently and more easily access the substantial and valuable knowledge in the KG, without knowing its data structures. QA-KG is a nontrivial problem since capturing the semantic meaning of natural language is difficult for a machine. Meanwhile, many knowledge graph embedding methods have been proposed. The key idea is to represent each predicate/entity as a low-dimensional vector, such that the relation information in the KG could be preserved. The learned vectors could benefit various applications such as KG completion and recommender systems. In this paper, we explore to use them to handle the QA-KG problem. However, this remains a challenging task since a predicate could be expressed in different ways in natural language questions. Also, the ambiguity of entity names and partial names makes the number of possible answers large.},

	abstract = {Machine Learning has been the quintessential solution for many AI problems, but learning models are heavily dependent on speciﬁc training data. Some learning models can be incorporated with prior knowledge using a Bayesian setup, but these learning models do not have the ability to access any organized world knowledge on demand. In this work, we propose to enhance learning models with world knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph (KG) fact triples for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Our aim is to develop a deep learning model that can extract relevant prior support facts from knowledge graphs depending on the task using attention mechanism. We introduce a convolutionbased model for learning representations of knowledge graph entity and relation clusters in order to reduce the attention space. We show that the proposed method is highly scalable to the amount of prior information that has to be processed and can be applied to any generic NLP task. Using this method we show signiﬁcant improvement in performance for text classiﬁcation with 20Newsgroups (News20) \& DBPedia datasets, and natural language inference with Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. We also demonstrate that a deep learning model can be trained with substantially less amount of labeled training data, when it has access to organized world knowledge in the form of a knowledge base.},

Existing methods have solved the key issue of how the NLI model can benefit from external knowledge. Inspired by this, we attempt to further explore the following two problems: (1) how to make better use of external knowledge when the total amount of such knowledge is constant and (2) how to bring external knowledge to the NLI model more conveniently in the application scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel joint training framework that consists of a modified graph attention network, called the knowledge graph attention network, and an NLI model. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing method which introduces external knowledge, and we improve the performance of multiple NLI models without additional external knowledge.},

In this paper, however, we verbalize the entire English Wikidata KG, and discuss the unique challenges associated with a broad, open-domain, largescale verbalization. We further show that verbalizing a comprehensive, encyclopedic KG like Wikidata can be used to integrate structured KGs and natural language corpora. In contrast to the many architectures that have been developed to integrate these two sources, our approach converts the KG into natural text, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into existing language models. It carries the further advantages of improved factual accuracy and reduced toxicity in the resulting language model. We evaluate this approach by augmenting the retrieval corpus in a retrieval language model and showing signiﬁcant improvements on the knowledge intensive tasks of open domain QA and the LAMA knowledge probe.},

Making these data accessible and useful for end-users is one of the main objectives of chatbots over linked data. Building a chatbot over linked data raises different challenges, including user queries understanding, multiple knowledge base support, and multilingual aspect. To address these challenges, we ﬁrst design and develop an architecture to provide an interactive user interface. Secondly, we propose a machine learning approach based on intent classiﬁcation and natural language understanding to understand user intents and generate SPARQL queries. We especially process a new social network dataset (i.e., myPersonality) and add it to the existing knowledge bases to extend the chatbot capabilities by understanding analytical queries. The system can be extended with a new domain on-demand, ﬂexible, multiple knowledge base, multilingual, and allows intuitive creation and execution of different tasks for an extensive range of topics. Furthermore, evaluation and application cases in the chatbot are provided to show how it facilitates interactive semantic data towards different real application scenarios and showcase the proposed approach for a knowledge graph and data-driven chatbot.},

	abstract = {Interactive recommender system (IRS) has drawn huge attention because of its flexible recommendation strategy and the consideration of optimal long-term user experiences. To deal with the dynamic user preference and optimize accumulative utilities, researchers have introduced reinforcement learning (RL) into IRS. However, RL methods share a common issue of sample efficiency, i.e., huge amount of interaction data is required to train an effective recommendation policy, which is caused by the sparse user responses and the large action space consisting of a large number of candidate items. Moreover, it is infeasible to collect much data with explorative policies in online environments, which will probably harm user experience. In this work, we investigate the potential of leveraging knowledge graph (KG) in dealing with these issues of RL methods for IRS, which provides rich side information for recommendation decision making. Instead of learning RL policies from scratch, we make use of the prior knowledge of the item correlation learned from KG to (i) guide the candidate selection for better candidate item retrieval, (ii) enrich the representation of items and user states, and (iii) propagate user preferences among the correlated items over KG to deal with the sparsity of user feedback. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach with significant improvements against state-of-the-arts.},

The method operates on the knowledge graph, an information representation technique alloying content-based and collaborative information. To generate recommendations, a two dimensional embedding is developed for the knowledge graph. As the embedding maps the users and the items to the same vector space, the recommendations are then calculated on a spatial basis. Regarding to the number of cold start cases, precision, recall, normalized Cumulative Discounted Gain and computational resource need, the evaluation shows that the introduced technique delivers a higher performance compared to collaborative ltering on top-n recommendation lists. Our further nding is that graph embedding based methods show a more stable performance in the case of an increasing amount of user preference information compared to the benchmark method.},

In this paper, we present Thomson Reuters’ effort in developing a family of services for building and querying an enterprise knowledge graph in order to address this challenge. We ﬁrst acquire data from various sources via different approaches. Furthermore, we mine useful information from the data by adopting a variety of techniques, including Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction; such mined information is further integrated with existing structured data (e.g., via Entity Linking techniques) in order to obtain relatively comprehensive descriptions of the entities. By modeling the data as an RDF graph model, we enable easy data management and the embedding of rich semantics in our data. Finally, in order to facilitate the querying of this mined and integrated data, i.e., the knowledge graph, we propose TR Discover, a natural language interface that allows users to ask questions of our knowledge graph in their own words; such natural language questions are then translated into executable queries for answer retrieval. We evaluate our services, i.e., named entity recognition, relation extraction, entity linking and natural language interface, on real-world datasets, and demonstrate and discuss their practicability and limitations.},
